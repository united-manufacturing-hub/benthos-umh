# Benthos FSM Package

This package implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) for managing Benthos instances. It is based on the s6 FSM package design, providing a consistent approach to service management across the codebase.

## Current Implementation Status

This is a skeleton implementation that provides the basic structure of the Benthos FSM. The following components are included:

1. **Core Data Structures**
   - `BenthosInstance`: Main struct implementing the FSMInstance interface
   - `BenthosObservedState`: Structure for tracking the observed state of the service
   - State and event constants defining the FSM transitions

2. **State Machine Logic**
   - Basic operational state transitions (Starting, Running, Stopping, Stopped)
   - Placeholder definitions for Benthos-specific states

3. **Reconciliation Logic**
   - Framework for driving the FSM towards the desired state
   - Basic integration with the underlying s6 service

4. **Manager Implementation**
   - Structure for managing multiple Benthos instances
   - Base reconciliation logic for creating, updating, and removing instances

## To Be Implemented

The following aspects need to be completed for full functionality:

1. **Benthos Configuration**
   - Implement the `BenthosConfig` type in the config package
   - Update service creation to use the Benthos-specific configuration
   - Add YAML parsing and generation for Benthos configuration files

2. **Port Management**
   - Implement a port manager to allocate unique ports for HTTP metrics endpoints
   - Update service configuration to use allocated ports

3. **Benthos-Specific State Monitoring**
   - Add metrics collection from Benthos HTTP endpoints
   - Implement log processing to detect warnings and errors
   - Create health checks to verify data processing activity

4. **Advanced State Transitions**
   - Implement the detailed state machine with Benthos-specific states
   - Add transition logic between these states based on observed metrics and health

5. **Benthos Service Layer**
   - Potentially create a BenthosService interface for interacting with Benthos
   - Implement validation of Benthos configurations

## Usage

Once fully implemented, the Benthos FSM will be used to:

1. Create and manage Benthos instances with proper configuration
2. Monitor the health and activity of Benthos services
3. Gracefully handle failures and restarts
4. Provide metrics and state information for management UIs

## Design Notes

- The Benthos FSM reuses the s6 service implementation for process management
- The state machine includes Benthos-specific states to represent the full lifecycle
- The implementation follows the same patterns as other FSM packages for consistency
